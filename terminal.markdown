# Agenda

 * What is LUG?
 * What is a terminal?
 * How do you configure terminals?
   * Configuration Files
   * Some pre-made packages
 * Using Linux in classes
   * Basic Linux file Structure

     * Makefiles
   * Common Useful commands
      

# Terminals

There are many shells that you can use.

These programs are known as shells, a command line interpreter to facilitating
interactions with the computer.

 * Bash (Bourne Again Shell)
 * zsh 
 * ksh (Korn Shell)
 * csh
 * fish
 * ...

Today, we'll talk about bash. Bash provides many useful features such as
tab completion, interpreted commands, command history and more!


# Configuring Shells

Most shells will allow you to customize many aspects of the shell by modifying
a configuration file.

bash: ~/.bashrc
zsh: ~/.zshrc

These files holds your personal settings for the particular shell. 

# Configuration Files

Some common settings to change:

 * PS1 (Prompt String 1) - This is an environment variable to control the 
   Prompt String. 
 * alias - Create a shortcut for another command.

# Some Premade packages

 * Sexy Bash Prompt - https://github.com/twolfson/sexy-bash-prompt

 * Powerline Shell  - https://github.com/banga/powerline-shell

 * Make your own! - http://bashrcgenerator.com/

# Basic Linux File Structure

 * /          - root 
 * /home      - Home directories
 * /bin       - Executables
 * /etc       - Configuration files
 * /usr/local - Unprivileged file storage
 * /opt       - Optional files, Extra
 * /var       - Variable files
 * /proc      - System Generated system info


# Compiling Code - Makefiles

Makefiles allow you to forget about the long compilation strings needed when
compiling.

Helps you automate specific tasks needed when compiling.
